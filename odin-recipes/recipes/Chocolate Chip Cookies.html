        <h1>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy</li>
            <li>Add Eggs and Vanilla: Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix Batter: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture, mixing until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Form Cookies: Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are golden brown. Do not overbake; cookies will be soft in the center and firm around the edges.</li>
            <li>Cool: Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
